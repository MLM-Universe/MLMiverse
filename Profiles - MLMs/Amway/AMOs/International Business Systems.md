The main Amway Motivational Organisation (aka Tools cult) was called International Business Systems (I think they deliberately tried to sound like IBM/International Business Machines). This was run by two Amway 'Diamond' couples: Jerry and Mandy Scriven, and Pat and Greta Gregory.

It disbanded in 2007 after the UK government investigated Amway, resulting in Amway cutting ties with IBS due to extensive focus on selling motivational 'Tools'. Because of this I had assumed there were no longer any AMOs, only motivational audio produced by Amway themselves, but maybe there are new ones that have formed and are hiding from public scrutiny.

Apparently there was another one called DTS in the late 90s which went bankrupt (Mentioned in the comments from 1998 archive linked below).
