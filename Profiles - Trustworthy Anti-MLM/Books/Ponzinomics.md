> Ponzinomics by Robert L. FitzPatrick, author of False Profits, is the first comprehensive account of how "multi-level marketing" was created in America, escaped criminal and civil prosecution and spread all over the world. It is the first book to fully explain how the legitimate business of "direct selling" was turned into pyramid recruiting. Ponzinomics dissects the elements that distinguish "multi-level marketing" from legitimate sales, and reveals how a "business" could become a delusional belief.  
> ​  
> Ponzinomics reveals how multi-level marketing helped to lay a foundation on Main Street for the presidency of Donald Trump with a program of pervasive deception, financial self-destruction, authoritarian leader-worship and economic make-believe.  
>   
> Ponzinomics is a discomforting look at the threads of American culture, business and politics that were woven into what has become the largest scam on Main Street.
