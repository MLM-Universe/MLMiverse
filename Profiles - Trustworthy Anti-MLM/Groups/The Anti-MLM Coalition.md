> We are a small group of activists who are passionate about lifting the lid on the MLM industry. The Anti-MLM Coalition was started in November 2017 by BotWatch, Elle Beau, Emma the Naked Typist and Red Corvette. Since that time most of this original team has stepped back, because of real life demands. Emma the Naked Typist is the only remaining original member. Others have stepped forward. Current Coalition members are based around the world, in both hemispheres. Some of us are ex-MLM members, and some have never been in an MLM but have been impacted by these businesses in our personal and professional lives.
