> Journalist Ellie Flynn goes undercover to investigate a multibillion-pound online selling industry that mostly targets young women with the opportunity to earn big money. 
> 
> The phenomenon known as ‘multi-level marketing’ is sweeping across social media as 'influencers' post job adverts offering the chance of six-figure incomes, cars and holidays in return for selling products online. More than 400,000 people in the UK are already signed up and the industry has thousands of passionate supporters. 
> 
> But as Ellie digs deeper into two companies, she uncovers a darker side behind these enticing Instagram posts and investigates accusations of illegal pyramid selling, systematic targeting of vulnerable people by recruiters and even brainwashing. 
> 
> Travelling the length of the country, Ellie meets former sellers like young mum Vickie, who made only £20 after spending six months following the training at cosmetics company Nu Skin in the hope she could make enough money for her maternity leave. Ellie also meets Lindsay, who has a chronic illness and hoped selling for makeup company Younique would help her cover the bills while she struggled to find full-time work. Three years later, Lindsay is now £3,000 in debt. 
> 
> In search of answers and accountability from these billion-dollar companies, Ellie’s investigation takes her to Utah, USA, where many of these companies are based. 
> 
> This film raises concerns about an industry which seems to remain largely overlooked by regulators and mainstream media. Ellie’s investigation uncovers a serious gap in awareness about the potential risks of becoming involved and lack of transparency about the true earning success rate
